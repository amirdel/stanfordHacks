### What is this repository for? ###

<!-- This code is for modeling macro-dispersion in random porous networks with temporal Markov models. -->

<!-- * Markov models in time for simulation dispersion in random porous networks -->
<!-- * The stencil method and the extended stencil method -->
<!-- * An implementation of correlated CTRW for benchmarking results -->

<!-- For details about the ideas and models used in this code please refer to -->
<!-- [Temporal Markov Processes for Transport in Porous Media: Random Lattice Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04173) -->


### How do I set it up? ###

* First clone this repository.
* run this command to create the conda env: `conda env create -f planet_pipeline/env.yml`
