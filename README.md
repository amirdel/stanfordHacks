# Fast building damage assessment using satellite imagery #

### What is this repository for? ###

We use a convolutional neural network to detect buildings in satellite data. We have tried several models
and acheive >0.6 intersection over union. We use our trained model on images of areas affected by natural or
 manmade disasters to estimate the number of buildings distroyed.

A result example from our neural net model can be seen below
